Communication with Tactronik is done using the messaging system provided by
libsmp. A command is sent by the client to the Tactronik module and then the
module send an answer.
For each message sent by client to Tactronik module, the client will receive a
response, either an ACK, an ERROR or a message from the RESP_* family. If client
receive no message, it means that the frame was never received by the module or
got corrupted.

Tactronik use the following UART configuration:
    Baudrate: 115200
    Data width: 8 bits
    Stop: 1 bit
    Parity: no
    Control Flow: no
